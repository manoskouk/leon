 *
 * @param subTrees The nonterminals that are used in the right-hand side of this [[ProductionRule]]
 *                 (and will generate deeper syntax trees).
 * @param builder A function that builds the syntax tree that this [[ProductionRule]] represents from nested trees.
 * @param tag Gives information about the nature of this production rule.
 * @param cost The cost of applying this rule (positive integer).
 * @param logProb Logarithmic probability of this rule being instantiated for a given nonterminal (based on a corpus)
  *               (will be a negative number).
 * @tparam T The type of nonterminal symbols of the grammar
 * @tparam R The type of syntax trees of the grammar
